# Laravel Payment Gateway with TALL Stack & Stripe ðŸš€

This is a public project demonstrating how to integrate modern payment methods like **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay** into a Laravel application. It is built with the **TALL stack** (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, and Laravel) and uses **Stripe Payment Intents** for a secure and robust payment flow.



***

## Key Features

* **Stripe Payment Intents:** Securely process payments without ever having your server handle sensitive card information.
* **Dynamic Payment Element:** Stripe's single UI component automatically displays relevant payment methods to the user (Cards, Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.).
* **TALL Stack:** A fully reactive frontend experience built with Livewire and Alpine.js.
* **Secure API Key Handling:** Follows Laravel best practices for managing secret keys using the `.env` file.
